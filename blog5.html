                  <p class="card-text">Matt grew up in the Sydney shire of Sutherland, and as he puts it, has ‘great memories of family life there’. Matt’s passion for food began at an early age in the kitchen of his great grandmother, Elsie. Matt credits Elsie, and his grandmother Elva, with inspiring his desire to pursue a culinary career – an inspiration that came full circle in 2014, when Matt catered for his grandmother’s 80th birthday. 
                     <p>&nbsp;</p> 
                    Matt’s first real foray into the hospitality industry came at the age of 19, when he began working at ‘Summer Salt’ in Cronulla. Working closely with the chefs there, Matt was constantly asking questions and, in his spare time, attempting to recreate his favourite dishes. 
                    
                    After a stint working in Canada as a bartender and landscaper, Matt chose to forgo a boys’ trip to Central and South America, deciding instead on a solo trip to India. This passion for new experiences was the driving force behind taking him to the MasterChef Australia kitchen. 
            
                    <p>&nbsp;</p> 
                    One of Matt’s fondest memories from being on MasterChef Australia, was the opportunity to travel to the United States and work in some of California’s best food trucks. The idea behind the food truck is one Matt identifies closely with and, in fact, immediately after finishing the MasterChef Australia competition, he and his best mate pursued their food truck dream in the form of a 20ft shipping container at Eat Street market in Brisbane. 
                    
                    After a successful stint at the markets, Matt along with 3 great friends took the plunge to make a long time dream a reality and opened the very successful Sum Yung Guys in Sunshine.
                    <p>&nbsp;</p> 
                    Their love for Asia is evident in the food, decor and ambiance of the restaurant and the success of this is evident in the numbers that come through the doors each day and night. 
                    
                    Matt's popularity and charisma has led to a number of great Ambassadorship and sponsorship opportunities and he was the Ambassador for Tourism Noosa in 2017 and 2018. Matt is currently the Ambassador for Tourism and Events Queensland and is passionate about the produce and environment in and around QLD and continues to promote the various regions. A popular talent at events, Matt appears at key events around the country including the Good Food & Wine Show, Regional Flavours and Grampians Grape Escape. More recently, Matt has been approached to head a number of major Campaigns including campaigns for Jacob’s Creek, Dell Computers and Australian Beef Association. 
                    <p>&nbsp;</p> 
                    TV work was always on the cards for this very popular personality and a new show 'The Cook's Pantry with Matt Sinclair' was developed for Channel Ten in 2017, with season 3 being filmed and airing in 2019. TV work continues with Matt being chosen as the new mentor on MasterChef Australia Season 11.  </p>
