                  <p class="card-text">At some point in time, what possibly began as a method to preserve fish in the Mekong Valley of Southeast Asia, the sushi travelled to Japan and over the centuries of its existence reached such high levels of evolution that today it's pretty much an art form.(Sushi, Sliced and Diced)In the American documentary Jiro Dreams of Sushi, Ono Jiro says, “The most important part of making good sushi is this: creating a union between the rice and the fish.  If they are not in complete harmony, the sushi won't taste good.” And he could not have been more accurate.A popular feature in Japanese cuisine the world over, the modern sushi rarely looks like its original self today. Chef Kamlesh Joshi of EDO, ITC Gardenia Bengaluru has been working with Japanese food for more than a decade, and says that when he began his career in New Delhi, it was the one cuisine that surprised him immensely.

                       “I couldn't imagine people were eating raw fish,” he says.(Gourmet Food - RAW)The Art of Eating SushiFor a first timer, the art of eating sushi can be a formidable task. But the tricks are fairly simple if you don't let the whole presentation of it get to you. Sushi is typically served with three condiments on the side - soy sauce, a dollop of wasabi (a dry green paste), and gari (pickled ginger). Interestingly, it's hard to source real wasabi, which is actually a plant, outside of Japan. Most restaurants replace it with horseradish, which has the similar pungency of the wasabi plant, mustard, starch, and the green food colouring of course.
                       <p>&nbsp;</p> 
                        Real wasabi is way more pungent than we are used to.Japanese cuisine added to world heritage listTraditionally, sushi is eaten with hands, and this is also why you ought to wash your hands before you start. In the case of a nigiri, you need to turn the sushi around (rice up, fish down), lightly dip it into the soy making sure that you don't dip the whole thing in, and eat it. For convenience what you can also do is mix the wasabi in the soy and then dip the sushi into it. Usually, chefs smear a little bit of wasabi between the fish and the rice; the extra bit is given if you want more.How to cook sushi riceNori is one of the primary ingredients that is used while preparing sushi as it acts as a wrapper to hold certain types of sushi together.

                        It is a kind of edible seaweed, and normally available as paper-thin green sheets in the supermarkets.Sea Spaghetti in the Supermarket: the Unstoppable Rise of SeaweedThe Sushi GuideThere aren't too many Japanese restaurants in the city, but the numbers are enough to keep sushi lovers happy; in fact, most people in the city don't even veer beyond the sushi when it comes to eating Japanese food.You can't really ‘know' sushi, unless you've spent years meditating before it, or eaten every possible sushi that has come out of every restaurant worth its name. However, here are a few basic ones to help you get started.Hosomaki </p>
